# Amusement Park Taxonomy Project
## Introduction
Welcome to the Amusement Park Taxonomy Project.
This repository is dedicated to developing a comprehensive taxonomy for amusement parks worldwide, classifying them based on various attributes including park types, attractions, operational environments, and visitor demographics. The taxonomy is designed to serve as a foundational framework for industry stakeholders, researchers, and enthusiasts to analyze, compare, and explore the diverse world of amusement parks. 

All taxonomy data is structured using JSON-LD format files to enhance interoperability and ease of integration, find more on the JSON-LD standard here: https://json-ld.org/.

##Project Overview
Amusement parks are complex entities that offer a wide range of attractions and experiences to diverse audiences. Understanding the nuances between different parks and their offerings can be challenging. This project addresses this challenge by creating a structured taxonomy that categorizes parks and their components across multiple dimensions such as:

- *Park Types*: Family Entertainment Centers, Adventure Parks, Resort-based Parks, etc.
- *Attraction Types*: Rides, Shows, Exhibitions, Walkthroughs, etc.
- *Operational Environments*: Indoor, Outdoor, Mixed.
- *Visitor Demographics*: Pricing structure, age groups, peak times.
