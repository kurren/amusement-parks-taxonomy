# Amusement Park Taxonomy Project
## Introduction
Welcome to the Amusement Park Taxonomy Project.
This repository is dedicated to developing a comprehensive taxonomy for amusement parks worldwide, classifying them based on various attributes including park types, attractions, operational environments, and visitor demographics. The taxonomy is designed to serve as a foundational framework for industry stakeholders, researchers, and enthusiasts to analyze, compare, and explore the diverse world of amusement parks. 

All taxonomy data is structured using JSON-LD format files to enhance interoperability and ease of integration, find more on the JSON-LD standard here: https://json-ld.org/.

## Project Overview
Amusement parks are complex entities that offer a wide range of attractions and experiences to diverse audiences. Understanding the nuances between different parks and their offerings can be challenging. This project addresses this challenge by creating a structured taxonomy that categorizes parks and their components across multiple dimensions such as:

- **Park Types**: Family Entertainment Centers, Adventure Parks, Resort-based Parks, etc.
- **Attraction Types**: Rides, Shows, Exhibitions, Walkthroughs, etc.
- **Operational Environments**: Indoor, Outdoor, Mixed.
- **Visitor Demographics**: Pricing structure, age groups, peak times.

## Goals
The primary goals of this project are:

- **Standardization**: Establish a uniform classification system that can be universally applied to understand and organize information about amusement parks.
- **Accessibility**: Provide an open-source taxonomy that can be utilized by developers, researchers, and business analysts within the amusement park industry.
- **Enhancement**: Continuously evolve the taxonomy based on community feedback and the changing landscape of amusement park attractions and technologies.

## Contributing
We encourage contributions from amusement park enthusiasts, industry professionals, and anyone interested in the classification and analysis of entertainment venues. Whether it's suggesting new categories, refining existing ones, or implementing the taxonomy in real-world applications, your input is valuable!

### How to Contribute
