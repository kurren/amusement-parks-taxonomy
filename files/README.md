# Detailed Taxonomy Structure
This section of the README provides a comprehensive overview of the taxonomy structure used in the Amusement Park Taxonomy Project. The taxonomy is designed to categorize and classify various aspects of amusement parks and entertainment venues into distinct, organized branches. This structured approach helps in better understanding and navigating the complex world of amusement parks.

## Taxonomy Overview
The Amusement Park Taxonomy is organized into several main branches, each focusing on different aspects of amusement park attributes and operations. Below is a detailed description of each branch:

- **Core Activity**: Organizes parks based on their core activities like:
  
  - *Attractions*
  - *Exhibitions*
  - *Shows*
  - *Wildlife*

- **Park Type**: Categorizes parks based on their primary characteristics and offerings, such as:
  
  - *Family Entertainment Centers (FEC)*
  - *Retail Villages*
  - *Adventure Parks*
  - *Ice, Sky, Snow Dome*
  - *Entertainment Complex*
    
- **Attractions Families**: Divides attractions into Rides and Non-Rides, further categorizing rides into sub-types:

  - *Rides*
    - *Light Rides*
    - *Dark Rides*
    - *Flat Rides*
    - *Gravity Rides*
    - *Vertical Rides*
    - *VR, 4D & Simulation Rides*
  - *Non-Rides*
    - *Walkthrough*
  
Shows Types: Differentiates between various show formats offered within parks, such as Theatre Shows, Arena Shows, and Marine Shows.
Exhibition: Focuses on parks that primarily offer exhibitions, detailing types like Art & Cultural Museums and Miniland.
Location: Defines parks based on their geographical settings, such as Urban, Coastal, or Rural locations.
Resort: Distinguishes between parks that are part of a resort and those that are standalone.
Operational Environment: Classifies parks by their operational environments, whether Indoor, Outdoor, or Mixed.
Waterpark: Differentiates between parks that focus on water-based attractions and those that do not.
Wildlife-Based Elements: Categorizes parks that feature wildlife attractions, such as Zoos, Safaris, and Aquariums.

This structure is implemented to ensure clarity and ease of access to information, enabling better data management and application across various projects and studies. Each branch is crucial for providing a holistic view of the amusement park industry, offering insights into the diverse ways parks can be organized and understood.
